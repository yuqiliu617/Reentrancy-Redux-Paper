\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of \ReentrancyTotalAnalyzed{} real-world reentrancy attacks on EVM-compatible blockchains from 2016 to 2024. Using both qualitative and quantitative methods, we offered a multi-dimensional view of the evolving nature of these attacks, including shifts in vulnerability characteristics and attacker strategies. Our study goes beyond conventional classifications, highlighting reentrancy's dual role as both an exploit vector and a legitimate design pattern. It also challenges outdated assumptions and illustrates how attackers adapt to bypass established defenses.

Our empirical evidence reveals critical trends: persistent attack frequency, increasingly complex scopes, evolving entry points beyond the \lstinline{fallback} function, and rapid exploitation timelines. We further demonstrate that reentrancy is often combined with other vulnerabilities to magnify its impact.

%We hope our insights—including attack patterns, limitations of current defenses, and future research directions—contribute to the development of more robust and adaptable security mechanisms for blockchain systems.
